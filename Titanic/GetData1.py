#The first thing to do is to import the relevant packages
# that I will need for my script, 
#these include the Numpy (for maths and arrays)
#and csv for reading and writing csv files
#If i want to use something from this I need to call 
#csv.[function] or np.[function] first

#The size function counts how many elements are in
#in the array and sum (as you would expects) sums up
#the elements in the array.
